The goal of this repository was to modify and adjust the [Android YouTube Extractor Library by Haariger Harald](https://github.com/HaarigerHarald/android-youtubeExtractor) to my needs and convert it to pure Java.
This goal was mostly achieved, though the general approach for retrieving YouTube metadata is not the best one, and YouTube limits the download speed drastically.
This doesn't fit my needs, and to overcome this, I'd also need to decode the n-parameter to fully emulate normal behavior and reach normal speeds.
While researching though, I found [this fantastic project](https://github.com/sealedtx/java-youtube-downloader). It fixes all the current problems and utilizes the InnerAPI, which is a much more elegant and feature-rich approach. Given this, I've decided to no longer actively use this repository.
